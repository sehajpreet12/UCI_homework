## Background
Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## D3 Dabbler

* A scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age. has created.

* A scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements using the D3 techniques has been created. The coded graphic in the app.js file in the js folder is pulled in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. The scatter plot will ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

* State abbreviations in the circles are included.

* Theaxes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart are created and situated.

**Note: The python -m http.server is used to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.**

## Assessment

The final product is based on the following metrics:

- Completion of all steps in the core assignment
- 
- Coherency of scatter plot (labels, ticks)
- 
- Visual attraction
- 
- Professionalism

The repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
